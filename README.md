# tic-tac-toe
Odin Project Implementation of the Tic Tac Toe project

This project was implemented in order to practice the following javascript techniques and design patterns:

1. General OOP practice
2. Factory functions use as opposed to constructors or ES6 class syntax
3. The module pattern in conjunction with IIFEs (immediately invoked function expressions) to have better code organization and namespacing

This game is intended to be played by 2 people. To play:

1. Input names for Players 1 and 2
2. Select a symbol for either Player 1 or 2. The opponents symbol will automatically be selected.
3. Click the "Start" button
4. The active player (X goes first) clicks to choose a square on the grid
5. The other player then chooses a square
6. Repeat Steps 5 - 6 until the game is finished or click the "Reset" button to reset the game board
